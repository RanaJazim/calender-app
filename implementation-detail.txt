I used React Big Calendar for calender and Bootstrap for simple styling things.
I didn't do fancy styling. I've just implemented the core functionallity that you were given to me.


How I implement this ?

1 - First of all I make a network request to countries for fetching all countries because the API you were provided to me had cover 230 
countries so that's why I make a network request 
and after successfull response I saved that response to redux store so later I could display all the countries on the select field.

2 - Then I make a second network request to all holidays. By default I used Pakistan as current country and extract the current 
month from current date i.e. Novemeber in my case.

3 - I've just used years 2017-2023 just to clear I've implemented all these features you were asked me to implement. But we can 
go further from 2022 by clicking on the next button.

4 - I did some optimizations i.e. I am keeping track of all the hollidays for different years that I've fetched for particular country. It means if I 
already visit the year for particular country then I don't make another network request instead I am fetching from redux store. 

5 - I can do some more optimizations like if I already visit the country then don't make another network request for fetching holidays
instead save that into the cache and when we visit the same country then fetch from the cache not from server. But for simplicity 
I didn't implement this.  

NOTE:
When we fetch hollidays for 2023 it will give no hollidays so that's not the error. This is coming from server.
And because I am just using years from 2017-2023 when we'll cross 2023 then select field value back to 2017 because I am using
years list from 2017-2023.
